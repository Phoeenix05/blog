#### Intro

If you're anything like me that means you like to build applications and websites but 
you also don't like JavaScript. Well do I have good news for you, you don't have to use
JavaScript, HTML and CSS to build your websites.

I build my desktop applications using web technologies like [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) 
along with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/). That works fine but at the same time it doesn't really
work. I mean that I don't like to use something like JavaScript to build desktop applications.
I still have to use [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) + Tauri to build desktop applications as WebAssembly is
still quite new and there aren't that many resources or tools available.

Writing your desktop application in Rust and compiling to WebAssembly feels better for me and
it isn't really that much harder than using something like [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/).
The tools that are currently available for building web applications with rust are few in number although
there are many web frameworks in rust for building websites with WebAssembly like [Yew](https://yew.rs/), 
[Leptos](https://leptos.dev/), [Sycamore](https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/) and more probably these 
are the most popular ones.

#### Examples

I'm going to compare React and Next with Sycamore in these examples.

Here is what a minimal `package.json` file looks like for a NextJS application using TypeScript.
```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@types/node": "20.5.1",
    "@types/react": "18.2.20",
    "@types/react-dom": "18.2.7",
    "autoprefixer": "10.4.15",
    "next": "13.4.19",
    "postcss": "8.4.28",
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "18.2.0",
    "tailwindcss": "3.3.3",
    "typescript": "5.1.6"
  }
}
```

Here is the equivalent `Cargo.toml` for Sycamore and Rust.
```toml
[package]
name = "my-app-rs"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
sycamore = "0.8.2"
```

With JavaScript frameworks like NextJS you are going to have multiple scripts that you have to run like
`dev`, `build`, `export` in some cases, `start` or `preview`, `lint` and probably more to get different tasks done.
In Rust you're going to have to install [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) to actually build and run the project.
Trunk only has two commands you really ever need to run those being `serve` for dev server and `build`.

These differences are quite trivial and doesn't really matter that much but it is still a factor to consider in my
opinion.

##### Type safety

If you're using TypeScript then you might think that your application is typesafe but it really isn't as
TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript and javascript isn't typesafe. But in Rust your application is going to fully
typesafe *(unless you do something really stupid)*.

##### Convenience

This section mainly applies if you're using [Tauri](https://tauri.app).

It is much more convenient for me to be able to write the entire application in rust than switching between
JavaScript and TypeScript to Rust and I believe this would be the case for most people. You probably could make
desktop applications purely in Rust without using [Tauri](https://tauri.app) though right now there arent that
many frameworks for building desktop applications in rust, the only example for framework I can think of is
[Iced](https://iced.rs/).

##### Components

```tsx
export const PokemonCard = () => {
  return (
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  )
}
```

The example above applies to both React and Solid I think.

```rust
#[component]
fn PokemonCard<G: Html>(cx: Scope) -> View<G> {
  view! { cx, h1 { "Hello, World" } }
}
```

From these basic examples you should be able to see that the Sycamore example is maybe a little bit more complex.

##### Component props

```tsx
interface Props {
  id: string
}

export const PokemonCard = ({ id }: Props) => {
  return (
    <p>{ id }</p>
  )
}

// I would not use this method for defining props, 
// but it is still possible.
export const PokemonCard = ({ id }: { id: string }) => {
  return (
    <p>{ id }</p>
  )
}
```

The example above should still apply to both React and Solid.

Now there are two ways to define props in Sycamore either using syntax similar to the React example above or
using the shorthand syntax.
```rust
#[derive(Props)]
struct PokemonCardProps {
  id: String
}

#[component]
fn PokemonCard<G: Html>(cx: Scope, props: PokemonCardProps) -> View<G> {
  view! { cx, p { (props.id) } }
}
```

Now this is what you were probably thinking about defining props in Sycamore but this is not all there is to it.
```rust
// With props we have to define a lifetime.
#[component]
fn PokemonCard<'a, G: Html>(cx: &'a Scope, props: &'a PokemonCardProps) -> View<G> {
  view! { cx, p { (props.id) } }
}
```

And now the shorthand syntax for Sycamore.
```rust
#[component(inline_props)]
fn PokemonCard<G: Html>(cx: Scope, props: PokemonCardProps) -> View<G> {
  view! { cx, p { (props.id) } }
}
```

When using the shorthand syntax (inline_props) you won't have to specify a lifetime.

#### Conclusion

There are differences between the frameworks but they are quite small especially if you're already
quite familiar with React or SolidJS then the differences are mainly due to the programming language.

Also, although I am probably the only one who is ever going to read this I still think I did a good job
of explaining things for my first blog post.

I will continue my bad explanation of the differences in the next part.

Thanks for reading.
